# Luex

This is a wrapper around the great [luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl).
The main aim of this project is to make easier to use in elixir.
This is mostly done via docs, typespecs and examples.
This wrapper wants you to only lazly derefernce tables (and userdata) into their elixir represenation.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `luex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:luex, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/luex>.

The cli is still heavily wip and not ready.
